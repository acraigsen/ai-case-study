They saw AI not just as another tech trend, but as a groundbreaking development that could benefit multiple sectors, from healthcare to automotive and beyond(2).

 As a publicly traded company, Nvidia is primarily funded by its operations, stock issuance, and other financial instruments. Nvidia went through initial rounds of venture capital funding, followed by its Initial Public Offering (IPO) in January 1999(3). Specific figures regarding the funding of individual projects within Nvidia are not public knowledge, but the company's overall R&D expenditure provides an indication of its commitment to innovation. From 2017 to 2023 Nvidia's R&D budget has grown from $1.4 billion to $7.3 billion(4).



## Business Activities

 NVIDIA's most recent endeavor, the *Instant NeRF* (Neural Radiance Fields) project, seeks to address a key challenge in the domain of 3D scene reconstruction and rendering. Traditional NeRF methods are computationally demanding, often necessitating hours or days to synthesize a single high-quality 3D scene from a set of photographs(5). With the *Instant NeRF* project NVIDIA is aiming to tackle the significant computational time and resources required by existing techniques. While these methods offer impressive quality, their resource-intensity make them impractical for real-time applications, such as video gaming, real-time filmmaking, or virtual reality(6).

 NVIDIA's *Instant NeRF* technology has a wide range for its target audience. At one end, there are professionals in the fields of architecture, game design, film production, and virtual reality, who require swift and high-quality 3D renderings. On the other end, particularly for VR and AR, general users can expect many new products and applications. The market for 3D rendering, animation, and VR is projected to grow rapidly, with some estimates suggesting it could exceed $280 billion by 2025(7).

 NVIDIA's *Instant NeRF* solution offers a distinct edge over competitors primarily due to its real-time rendering capability. NVIDIA's version, optimized for their GPUs, brings the capabilities of quality and speed together(8). This combination potentially positions NVIDIA at a unique point in the 3D rendering market. This competitive advantage stems from NVIDIA's legacy and expertise in GPU development and optimization. Their deep understanding of parallel processing, combined with decades of research in graphics technology, grants them an "unfair advantage" when it comes to optimizing algorithms for real-time performance(9). A cornerstone of the *Instant NeRF* project is its use of NVIDIA's latest GPUs and the associated software stack. These GPUs, designed for high-performance tasks, are made for the parallel processing demands of NeRF algorithms(10). NVIDIA's *Instant NeRF* is built upon the CUDA platform. CUDA is a parallel computing platform and application programming interface model created by NVIDIA(11). This allows the project to use the full power of NVIDIA GPUs ensuring efficient execution of the intricate NeRF computations.

 NVIDIA's engineering blogs and research papers further indicate a seamless integration of AI and deep learning frameworks within the *Instant NeRF* methodology. Tools like NVIDIA's Deep Learning AI, coupled with their GPU-optimized Tensor libraries, play pivotal roles in refining the NeRF algorithms for real-time application(12). NVIDIA's technology (comprising proprietary GPUs, software stacks like CUDA, and AI frameworks) presents a comprehensive system optimized for tasks like NeRF. While competitors might employ NeRF methodologies, NVIDIA's integrated approach and GPU optimization are probably unmatched. By addressing the speed bottleneck of traditional NeRF techniques, NVIDIA not only displays its capability in graphics technology but also paves the way for real-time 3D rendering's future.



## Landscape

 NVIDIA predominantly operates within the field of graphics processing and advanced computing. Jensen Huang, the CEO of NVIDIA, once encapsulated the company's mission:
 >"Our work is at the center of the most consequential mega-trends in technology."(13)
 NVIDIA has become synonymous with cutting-edge GPUs, which are pivotal in both gaming and professional applications that demand high fidelity visualizations.

 In the past 5–10 years, the realm of 3D rendering and visualization has undergone monumental shifts. A major trend has been the integration of artificial intelligence with graphics rendering, enabling more efficient, realistic, and dynamic visual outputs. Neural Radiance Fields, or NeRF, emerged as an innovation in this domain. This technology synthesizes novel views of intricate 3D scenes using only a sparse set of input photographs, but its potential was initially limited due to extensive computational time(14). It is into this situation that NVIDIA introduced its *Instant NeRF* project. Based on their legacy in GPU development, NVIDIA's *Instant NeRF* seeks to utilize the capabilities of their advanced GPUs to make NeRF computations real-time, addressing the primary bottleneck of the original NeRF techniques(15). The graphics and visualization field, once primarily focused on visual fidelity alone, is now at the nexus of several tech trends—AI, real-time rendering, and more.

 Other major players in the broader field include AMD and Intel. AMD, with its Radeon graphics, has been a longstanding competitor to NVIDIA's GeForce series. Intel, traditionally known for CPUs, has been entering into the GPU market with its Intel Xe line(16). Each of these companies brings a unique approach to graphics processing and computing, contributing to the rapid evolution of the industry.
